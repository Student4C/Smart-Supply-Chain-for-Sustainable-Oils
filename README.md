# Smart-Supply-Chain-for-Sustainable-Oils
Artificial Intelligence to optimise the distribution of organic oils from Kenya to global markets. 

## Summary
This project uses Artificial Intelligence to optimize the distribution of organic, cold-pressed oils from Kenya to global markets. By predicting demand, improving logistics, and minimizing waste, the system supports both sustainability and charity funding for destitute children in Kenya.

Background
The export and distribution of high-quality Kenyan oils face frequent challenges such as inconsistent logistics, unstable demand, and limited transparency. These inefficiencies increase costs and reduce profits that could otherwise fund community programs for children in need.
This project combines my passion for sustainability and social impact. I run a business that distributes organic oils and funds a charity for children in Kikambala, Kenya. By integrating AI, I hope to make our supply chain smarter, reduce losses, and increase funds for education and food programs.

Problems solved:
Unpredictable market demand
Transportation inefficiencies
High operational costs reducing charity funding

How is it used?
The AI system uses predictive analytics to forecast demand in different markets and recommends optimal shipping routes based on real-time data such as weather, port congestion, and pricing trends.

Users include:
Export managers who plan shipments
Logistics teams coordinating deliveries
Charity administrators monitoring funds generated from sales
Data sources and AI methods

Data sources:
Historical export and sales records from Kenya and the UK
Real-time logistics and shipping data (APIs)
Market price and seasonal demand data from online marketplaces

AI methods:
Regression models for price prediction
Time-series forecasting for demand planning
Optimization algorithms for route and cost minimization
Neural networks for dynamic supply-demand matching

Challenges
Limited availability of clean, consistent data from developing regions
Ethical considerations around automation and job displacement
Infrastructure limitations affecting real-time data collection

What next?
In the future, this project could expand into a full AI-powered supply chain platform that connects Kenyan producers, global buyers, and logistics partners â€” ensuring fair trade and transparency.
It could also integrate a donation tracking system so customers can see how their purchase directly supports children in need.
